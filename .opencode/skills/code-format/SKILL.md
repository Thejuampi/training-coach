description: Apply Spotless code formatting to all Java/Kotlin files.

## What I do
- Run `./mvnw spotless:apply` to format code per Palantir Java Format.
- Check for any unformatted files and fix them.
- Ensure imports are ordered (java.* → third-party → com.training.coach.*).

## When to use me
Use before commits or after editing code to maintain consistent style.
