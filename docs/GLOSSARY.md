# Training Coach Glossary

This glossary defines common training and platform terms used in the project.

## Thresholds and Zones

- **LT1**: First lactate/ventilatory turn point (aerobic threshold). Boundary between Z1 and Z2.
- **LT2**: Second lactate/ventilatory turn point (anaerobic threshold). Boundary between Z2 and Z3.
- **Z1 (Low)**: Below LT1.
- **Z2 (Moderate)**: Between LT1 and LT2.
- **Z3 (High)**: Above LT2.
- **Z2 creep**: Excess time accumulating in Z2, which undermines polarized distribution.

## Prescription Bands (Inside Zones)

- **FATMAX**: A band within upper Z1 where fat oxidation is often near maximal.
- **VO2-optimal**: High-intensity work around ~105–115% FTP (cycling) aimed at VO2 stimulus.
- **Sprint/neuromuscular**: Very short, very high power above VO2-optimal.

## Common Metrics

- **FTP**: Functional Threshold Power (cycling).
- **FTHR**: Functional Threshold Heart Rate.
- **VO2max**: Maximal oxygen uptake.
- **TSS**: Training Stress Score (proxy for training load).
- **IF**: Intensity Factor (normalized power / FTP).
- **CTL/ATL/TSB**: Chronic/Acute Training Load and Training Stress Balance (load trends).

## Training Concepts

- **Polarized distribution**: Emphasize Z1 and Z3 with minimal Z2.
- **Readiness**: A composite score derived from wellness + load signals.
- **Compliance**: Adherence of completed training vs planned training.

## Auth and Privacy

- **Access token**: Short-lived JWT used for API requests.
- **Refresh token**: Long-lived token used to obtain a new access token.
- **Consent log**: Audit record of data export or deletion approvals.
